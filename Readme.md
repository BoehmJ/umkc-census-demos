## Tidy Data & Tidy Census

Hadley Wickham coined the term [**Tidy Data**](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) Essentially, this is data presented in **long** format, with data/metadata contained in additional columns. Each combination of a variable, year, geography effectively becomes its own row. Data can be easily joined to other dataframes, grouped and summarized, or pivoted to a **wide** format using R.
